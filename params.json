{"name":"OkShell","tagline":"a command line interface for humans","body":"What is OkShell\r\n===============\r\n\r\nOkShell is a command line interface for humans. \r\n\r\nWith OkShell you never need to remember\r\n\r\n    $ find . -type f -name \\*.txt -exec sed -i 's/Alice/Bob/g' {} \\;\r\n\r\ninstead you can simply do\r\n\r\n    $ ok replace Alice with Bob in all txt files\r\n\r\nBelow is a link to a presentation that explains what OkShell is all about.\r\n\r\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HG6YCgUMHHSWAYLbdabj1I1z9pmOVZQp5VvIinCIlXA/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000\">OkShell Introduction</a>\r\n\r\nFor questions and feedbacks, please email <okshell.official@gmail.com>.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Install\r\n==============\r\n\r\nThe installation of OkShell is currently in \"pro mode\", i.e., you need to\r\ncompile it from the source code and know what you are doing. It will become\r\nmore convenient for general users in future releases.\r\n\r\nCurrently supported operating systems: Most Linux distributions, e.g., Ubuntu,\r\nRedHat, etc.\r\n\r\nTo install:\r\n\r\n1. Download source code of OkShell by (if you have Git installed)\r\n\r\n\t\t$ git clone https://github.com/larryyueli/okshell.git\r\n\r\n\tor download the zip file or tar.gz file.\r\n\r\n2. Make sure you have the following packages installed on your computer.\r\n\r\n\t- g++ version 4.6 or above (recommanded package: build-essential)\r\n\t- libboost-dev\r\n\t- libboost-serialization-dev\r\n\t- libboost-regex-dev\r\n\t- libboost-filesystem-dev\r\n\t- libboost-system-dev\r\n\r\n3. Under `okshell` directory, run `make`\r\n\r\n4. Run `sudo make install`\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Use\r\n==========\r\n\r\nYou could be in one of two modes when using OkShell: NORMAL mode or CONFIG\r\nmode. \r\n\r\nWhen you are in NORMAL mode, you just want to run some command (90% of use\r\ncases). Just type `ok` followed by whatever you want to do. For example,\r\n\r\n    $ ok replace \"good\" with \"great\" in txt files\r\n\r\nWhen you are in CONFIG mode occasionally, you want to run some configuration\r\ntasks. Just type `ok` twice, followed by some configuration command.
